# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrect innerHTML appending

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to manipulating the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element.  The issue arises when attempting to append new content to the existing `innerHTML` without proper handling of potential edge cases or existing content.

The `bug.html` file showcases the problem, and `bugSolution.html` provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The bug is caused by directly appending to `innerHTML` without checking if the element's content is properly formatted or empty.  This can lead to unexpected rendering issues or unintended behavior.  In this specific example, there's a risk of unintentionally destroying the structure or content already present within the div.
